Unfortunately, as an AI language model, 
I cannot see the code you are referring to. 
However, to synchronize the height of #side-bar 
and three other sections, you can use JavaScript
 to calculate the height of the tallest section
  and set that height as the height of all the other
   sections. Here's an example code snippet:


var maxHeight = Math.max($('#side-bar').height(), $('#section1').height(), $('#section2').height(), $('#section3').height());
$('#side-bar, #section1, #section2, #section3').height(maxHeight);
This code calculates the maximum height among #side-bar, #section1, #section2, and #section3 elements and sets that height as the height of all the elements using the jQuery height() method.
